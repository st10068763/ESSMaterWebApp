                        "My introduction to Materfamilia Social Enterprise and related parties as both beneficiary and volunteer chief financial officer (CFO) is not an overnight success story.  Since the time I reached out to Business Coach Ann Ligman via a leading Christian Radio station that aired her adverts and interviewed her, my journey has been totally changed. What started as a plea for mentoring ended in an over five (5) years journey of selfless investment of time, coaching, mentoring and training and experiential work learning  at no cost by visionary. After completing International Certificate In Bookkeeping (ICB) at a bogus institution I was stucked in retail. The only really exciting and encouraging occurrence in my prosaic existence was the sessions with Ann. I used to go for sessions with her after work or on my mandatory off days, just for an opportunity to apply my Bookkeeping skills.
                        Today, almost ten (10) years later, I finally

                        pursued tertiary education in the accounting field through a recognised distance learning university. Today still I rely on Ann's advices and guidance to navigate the painful journey of correspondence studies whilst working a very taxing retail job.  Looking back, one thing always stood out about Ann's advices:
                        "DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP WHEN YOU MAKE MISTAKES. IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO LEARN, PRACTICALLY. FACE YOUR FEAR OF FAILURE AND YOU ARE BOUND TO BE SUCCESFUL IN THIS JOURNEY."
                        I benefited from Be Absorbed Incubator COJ Chapter 2018 with Ann as primary project architect and facilitator of all Bookkeeping a d tax modules, amongst others. It inspired  me to finally consider further education and training. What I love about my present studies is that everything I learnt over the years in this relationship becomes more and more relevant on a daily basis.
                        I frequently express my gratitude and at

                        times wish I had capacity to give back more to Materfamilia Social Enterprise and sister companies but the long hours in retail prevents me from optimizing on the opportunity. Nevertheless, being a beneficiary and volunteer of these programs I pray that investors will recognize the potential of the brand and channel more resources towards it so that more female headed households can benefit from it.
                        Like my family."

                        "The day I met the visionary of Materfamilia Social Enterprise, I instinctively knew it is a remarkable day in my life. I immediately informed her that henceforth we will be inseparable and concur many demons together. Little did I realise the prophetic nature of that declaration. What I learnt in this journey is to recognise all my gifts snd turn them into value adding solutions as entrepreneur solving real problems in the communities I serve. Every single day is a

                        learning experience.  Ann is a very hard business coach but with a lot of empathy born from a deep understanding of how past mistakes, family and extended relationships and lack of education can cripple the most gifted person. Ann taught me over a period of thirteen months more then I learnt in four (4) decades of life.  Most importantly she taught me my obsession with order and hygiene don't necessarily need to be a drawback factor on this journey but rather a great value add if channeled into profitable business activities. Hence my business tag line is "OCD precision".  I am no longer shamed by my past and by my present. In fact, I am so focused on mastering this entrepreneurial journey and excelling in business to create family wealth legacy, that I have little time to procrastinate about past failures and lacks. Since I started this journey and invested in the Be Absorbed Incubator Stellenbosch Chapter programs within the Materfamilia

                        family, I have grown from strength to strength even spiritually and professionally and evolved as a parent that want to be an active participant in my girls' education and sports career. I would not have capacity to pursue new and exciting wealth creation goals without the patient yet uncompromisingly strict guidance of my business coach.

                        Today I find utter enjoyment to exercise my gifts in sports, spiritual matter and Entrepreneurship as well as family life enhance through particularly the divorce coaching modules I completed and my ex wife and our children directly benefit from as well.

                        I learnt that it is never too late to pursue new goals and that I am not top old to learn and acquire new skills and knowledge.

                        "In October 2023 started my virtual divorce coaching financial analysis journey with visionary and key person Ann Ligman under the DivorCFAnn umbrella. I was referred by a member of our church in City of Joburg municipality who met Ann in divorce coaching sessions hosted by our church.
                        During this journey I was equipped with so much skills and knowledge on how to navigate justice, social, health and professional systems, it left me astounded. Twelve (12)  months  down the line my fait accompli matter was handed over to a qualified advocate with a complete pack of supporting evidence patiently solicited under Ann's guidance and packaged in a manner to facilitate both the preciding magistrate and the legal counsel as well as empower the opposing counsel and my ex husband with the relevant understanding of exactly how crippling my divorce settlements nine (9) years ago was to the holistic health and

                        wellness and wealth of my three (3) special needs children and I. My former husband simply lacked the willingness and the emotional capacity to understand exactly how much damage was done by his total reliance on his historic legal counsel and blood relative.
                        Looking back I am eternally grateful for the time and resources and hospitality and kindness the organization channeled in my direction. I have learnt to value myself, my skills and my gifts and to exercise it unapologetically in the interest of my family's well-being. I had to work on areas where I had my own biases and prejudice affirmed by systems and had to panel beat my mind daily to adjust to the realities that I am facing. During this journey I managed to get back into a professional teaching job but also established my personal brand as a virtual teacher.
                        As a white female with a background of privilege and favor, it was an eye opening journey and today I can confidently say I have gained more knowledge about my responsibilities as primary custodian and that of my former husband. I learnt to let go of my paranoia pertaining my children's ability to find for themselves and I am eternally grateful and relieved to attest to their independence both as students or learners and as young adults navigating life bravely without being tied to mommy's apron.

                        We are an empowered family today due to the benefits of this association."
